// Minimal file storage - only for backwards compatibility
// All data should now come from the Go API backend
// This file is kept temporarily for any remaining references

// Note: User management (guests/technicians) functionality in user-manager.tsx
// currently uses file storage as there are no backend APIs for this yet.
// This should be implemented in the backend when needed.
